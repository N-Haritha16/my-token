MyToken – ERC-20 Style Token (Solidity + Remix)

This project showcases the creation and deployment of a basic ERC-20–style token using Solidity in the Remix IDE. The purpose of this project is to understand how tokens work on the Ethereum blockchain, how contracts are compiled and deployed, and how token transactions are executed and verified.

Overview

MyToken is a simple Ethereum-based token that demonstrates the essential concepts of token creation. It includes properties such as token name, symbol, decimals, and a fixed total supply. The initial supply is minted directly to the deployer’s wallet when the contract is deployed. The contract also supports transferring tokens between users and logs each transfer event on the blockchain.

Features

Custom token name, symbol, and decimals

Fixed total supply assigned to the deployer

Balance tracking for each address

Secure token transfer functionality

Transfer event logging for transaction verification

Technologies Used

Solidity 0.8.x

Remix IDE

JavaScript VM / MetaMask

EVM-compatible blockchain environment

What Was Done

The smart contract was written in Solidity to implement basic ERC-20–like functions.

The contract was compiled using the Remix Solidity compiler.

The contract was deployed through the Remix Deploy panel.

Token information such as name, symbol, decimals, and total supply was verified.

Token transfers were tested between different accounts to validate the logic.

Transfer events were observed in the Remix logs to confirm blockchain activity.

Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned how token contracts work, how to deploy them on Remix, how to interact with different functions, and how Ethereum events track blockchain activity. It helped build a strong foundation in smart contract development and Web3 concepts.
